# Audio_Mixer_model
<p> This is just a model of a mixer which I made in Google Colaboratory, It really doesn't work like a real audio mixer :P </p>
<p> Please feel free to leave comments about this project model. Don't say anything like it doesn't work like a real mixer because as I said earlier it is not a real audio mixer. </p>
<h1> Why I made this? </h1>
<p> The reason why I made this is because I intended to make it like a pastime toy if you have don't have anything to do! </p>
